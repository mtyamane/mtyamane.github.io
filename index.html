            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Mark Yamane! I graduated from Eckerd College in May 2022 with Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science and 
                Marine Science. My interest in the ocean has driven my pursuits in both ocean research and data science, so in my free time 
                you can find me hiking around Washington, scuba diving off of Edmonds, or taking low-tide beach walks in West Seattle. I made
                this site to showcase some of my projects and past research, so feel free to check them out below!

                    <p>
                        I created an R package out of functions I used to perform biodiversity analyses on data from visual dive surveys 
                        I conducted with a group for my Winter Term in Roatan, Honduras. We conducted a study on the effects of lionfish derbies 
                        on the native predator fish assemblages (which now compete with the invasive lionfish). This package has functions to 
                        find species richness, species evenness, and Shannon diversity index for uni-, bi-, and multivariate data from a csv 
                        file. 'biod' also includes some functions for graphing the diversity values.

                        I created a discord bot called "Raxin" to facilitate reaction polls in Discord. I was the president of Tabletop Club at
                        Eckerd College when COVID hit the US in March 2021, so when Tabletop Club had to go virtual I chose Discord as the solution.
                        When we split out into groups or were deciding what games to play, it was often way too chaotic to go off of the chat 
                        or audio conversations.I decided to create a bot to easily and intuitively create polls where people could respond using 
                        the given reactions attached to the polls. This bot was used many times when we were virtual and still when we phased 
                        back to in-person meetings.

                        taught how to create a website using HTML and CSS, as well as incorporated discussions about ethical problems in 
                        the social media sphere. During sophomore year, I decided to take some time to learn more about CSS and JavaScript by
                        making this site!

                    <h3>Tortoise Recognition</h3>
                    <p>
                        Re-identification is a crucial time-consuming task for many studies on behavioral ecology. For my senior thesis at 
                        Eckerd College, I developed a neural network with Dr. Michael Hilton to identify individual gopher tortoises based on 
                        carapace markings in a manner similar to how facial recognition is used on humans. The model calculates a difference 
                        value to return the five most similar gopher tortoises from a reference database. Once the model achieved 95% accuracy,
                        we incorporated it into existing camera trap analysis software to aid future studies defining the social networks of 
                        gopher tortoises at Boyd Hill Nature Preserve.

                    <h3>Arctic Weather Model Validation</h3>
                    <p>
                        As sea ice is diminishing at unprecedented rates, accurate weather forecasting of the Arctic Ocean is pertinent for 
                        management and conservation of marine resources and coastal communities. During an REU at the Pacific Marine Environmental 
                        Laboratory with Dr. Chidong Zhang, I validated ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather 
                        Forecasts (ECMWF) against observations from saildrones - remotely controlled uncrewed surface vehicles that measure 
                        atmospheric and surface ocean variables. Forecast errors in dynamical variables began small and grew over time while 
                        forecast errors in thermodynamical variables began large and stayed large over time up to a lead time of 15 days. This 
                        study provides additional insights to the degree to which ensemble forecasts may be advantageous to deterministic 
                        forecasts within the range of 15 days.

                    <h3><b>Harvest Cessation in Marine Reserves</h3>
                    <p>
                        Determining whether illegal harvest (poaching) has continued in a protected area is important to planning enforcement 
                        and adaptive management.During an REU at Hatfield Marine Science Center with Dr. Will White, I used a state-space 
                        integral projection model to estimate harvest rates for four kelp forest fish species inside marine protected areas (MPAs) 
                        and non‐MPA reference sites in the California Channel Islands, from 2003 (when MPAs were implemented) to 2017. This 
                        modeling approach could provide a tool to complement the long‐term management of MPA networks, particularly given the 
                        difficulty of acquiring harvest rate data at the spatial scale of individual MPAs. This internship resulted in a 
                        co-authored paper published to Conservation Letters.
